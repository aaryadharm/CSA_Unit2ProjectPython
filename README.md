# CSA_Unit2ProjectPython

Authors: Ella DeGuzman and Aarya Dharm

This is the Python Hangman made using Pygame. 
This is one part that is being used to compare the advantages and disadvatages to using python/pygame vs Java/JavaSwing.
To play this game, the user just has to press the letter that they think is in the word. 
Then if it is in the word, it will show where the letter is on the blanks.
If it is not in the word, a body part will appear on the hangman.
All the words are randomized and are words related to programming and the AP CSA curriculum.
